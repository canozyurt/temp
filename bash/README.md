I had prepared this old bash script for a teammate who reported that a crucial plugin didn't compile. We were upgrading to a newer version and bodyaccess plugin wasn't available for the new version at that time. I fixed the conflict and bundled it with a quick install steps. Probably this script is useless now since you can find the official repo that successfully builds.
